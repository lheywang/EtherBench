# Hardware

This folder contain all the ressources for the hardware, which I built with Altium Designer.

Due to it's binary files format, I can't easily push the files in git, that's why, in this folder you'll only find : 
- PDF schematic exports
- Explanations
- Datasheets

If you're interessted into getting your hands on the project, don't worry : Look on the releases, there will be two zip folders :
- A Gerber zip, ready to be sent to JLCPCB / PCBWAY, to be produced
- An Altium zip, with the complete project sources.
